***********************************
* OpenSSL - 0.9.8zh               *
***********************************

This folder is just to try compiling OpenSSL 0.9.8zh fÃ¼r x86-64 and arm64.
It requires a manual change in 'Configuration' to be able to build.
That's because that version is old, and doesn't containt a build configuration for darwin64-arm64.

1. Extract the downloaded .tgz
2. Search for the line in Configuration containing: darwin64-x86_64-cc
3. duplicate that line
4. in that duplicated line: replace the following:
   darwin64-x86_64-cc   ->   darwin64-arm64-cc
   arch x86_64          ->   arch arm64
5. Copy the modified file 'Configuration' next to the 'build.sh'
   and rename it to 'Configure_098_arm64'
6. Note: build.sh will replace the Configuration with your modified version for the arm64 build.


Also note that the OpenSSL API is different in 0.9.8 compared to 1.1.x.
So if you're going to try this, you'd need to manually change the Declares in the Example project:

OpenSSL 1.1
-----------
Const constLibCrypto = "@executable_path/../Frameworks/libcrypto.1.1.dylib"
Declare Function OpenSSL_version Lib constLibCrypto (i As Integer) As CString
Me.Text = OpenSSL_version(0)
Dim sData As String = ConvertEncoding(OpenSSL_version(0), Encodings.UTF8)


OpenSSL 0.9.8
-----------
Const constLibCrypto = "@executable_path/../Frameworks/libcrypto.0.9.8.dylib"
Declare Function SSLeay_version Lib constLibCrypto (i As Integer) As CString
Me.Text = SSLeay_version(0)
Dim sData As String = ConvertEncoding(SSLeay_version(0), Encodings.UTF8)
