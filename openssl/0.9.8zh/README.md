# How to: Build OpenSSL 0.9.8zh on macOS

## Intro
This folder is just to try compiling OpenSSL 0.9.8zh fÃ¼r x86-64 and arm64.  
It requires a manual change in 'Configuration' to be able to build.
That's because that version is outdated, and doesn't containt a build configuration for darwin64-arm64.
So don't use this for production!

## Let's build OpenSSL 0.9.8zh
1. Extract the downloaded [openssl-0.9.8zh.tar.gz](https://www.openssl.org/source/old/0.9.x/openssl-0.9.8zh.tar.gz)
2. Search for the line in ```Configuration``` containing:  
   ```darwin64-x86_64-cc```
3. duplicate that line
4. in that duplicated line: replace the following:  
   ```
   darwin64-x86_64-cc   ->   darwin64-arm64-cc  
   arch x86_64          ->   arch arm64
   ```
5. Copy the modified file ```Configuration``` next to the ```build.sh```
   and rename it to ```Configure_098_arm64```
6. Note: ```build.sh``` will replace the Configuration with your modified version for the arm64 build.

Note: The OpenSSL API is different in 0.9.8 compared to 1.1.x and 3.0.x.  
Even just getting the OpenSSL Version requires different calls...  
See the example project, which includes several OpenSSL Versions.
